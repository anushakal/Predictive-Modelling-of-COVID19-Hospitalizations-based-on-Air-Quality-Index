# Predictive-Modelling-of-COVID19-Hospitalizations-based-on-Air-Quality-Index

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for predicting COVID-19 hospitalization rates based on air quality index (AQI) data. The project aims to explore the correlation between long-term exposure to low air quality environments and COVID-19 hospitalization rates.

## Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing COVID-19 case Electronic Health Record (EHR) data comprising 37 million rows. Employed PySpark to explore the correlation between AQI and COVID-19 hospitalization rates.

## Key Findings

- We found a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.72 between AQI and hospitalization rates.
- Higher AQI was associated with a 25% increase in hospitalization risk.

## Methodology

We employed advanced statistical techniques, including multiple linear regression and imputation methods, to control confounding factors and address missing data in the analysis.

## Visualizations

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our findings, we presented the results visually using RShiny and Matplotlib charts.
